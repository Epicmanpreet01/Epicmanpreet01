# Hi, I’m **Manpreet Singh**

**(@Epicmanpreet01)**

## About Me

I’m a third-year **B.Tech (Computer Science & Engineering)** student from India with strong hands-on experience in **full-stack development** and **applied AI/ML systems**. I enjoy designing production-ready architectures that combine **modern web stacks** with **custom machine learning services**, focusing on scalability, performance, and clean system design.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in:

- AI/ML model integration into real-world applications
- Backend-driven architectures and system workflows
- Computer vision, NLP, and ML explainability
- Building polished, deployment-ready products

## Featured Projects

### **FutureGuard – Student Dropout Risk Prediction System**

A full-stack ML-driven platform for predicting student dropout risk using a **Node.js + MongoDB backend** and a **FastAPI ML microservice**.
Includes role-based dashboards (SuperAdmin, Admin, Mentor), CSV ingestion, feature normalization, explainable ML predictions (XGBoost), and institute-level analytics.

**Key Highlights**

- Secure JWT-based RBAC architecture
- ML microservice integration (FastAPI)
- No raw student data stored (privacy-aware design)
- Aggregated analytics across multiple hierarchy levels
